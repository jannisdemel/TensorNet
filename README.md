# TensorNet
This repo is about the TensorNet architecture presented in the paper "TensorNet: Cartesian Tensor Representations for Efficient Learning of Molecular Potentials" by Simeon et al. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06482). The code to this project is available at https://github.com/torchmd/torchmd-net.
The following files are interesting in this repo:
- tensornet.py is the definition of the model. The code is adapted from the repo given in the papaer but simplified and commented.
- Tutorial_TensorNet.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook that goes step-by-ste through how TensorNet works and was created for myself to understand what is happening.
